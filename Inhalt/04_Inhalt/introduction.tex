		This thesis is organized into seven main chapters. Chapter \ref{chap:intro} introduces the motivation, contributions, and overall objectives of the work. Chapter \ref{chap:prelims} provides the theoretical foundations necessary for understanding the proposed methods, including concepts from linear optimization, graph theory, hashing, and algorithmic parallelization.

		Chapter \ref{chap:related} reviews related research and situates this work within the broader scientific context. Chapter \ref{chap:gcg} presents the framework of \ac{GCG}, discussing its underlying principles, detection mechanisms, and illustrative examples.
		Here, the primary focus is a sufficient understanding of the algorithmic principles and the current state \textit{as is}.

		Building on this, Chapter \ref{chap:tree} describes our Tree Refinement approach in detail, outlining its algorithmic design, classification strategies, and evaluation criteria.
		We build upon the principles discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:gcg} to design an algorithm which can be seamlessly integrated into the existing framework.
		Chapter \ref{chap:impl} focuses on implementation aspects, covering system architecture, data structures, concurrency mechanisms, and methods for ensuring computational efficiency and avoiding unnecessary computations.

		Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:eval} evaluates the proposed methods through experimental studies, detailing the setup, datasets, and performance analysis using instances from the StrIPlib and MIPLIB libraries. The thesis concludes with a summary of findings and potential directions for future research.
