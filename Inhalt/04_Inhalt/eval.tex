			\caption{The distribution of different categories of model within \acs{strIPlib}. Most problems are part of \enquote{common} categories like Bin-Packing, Scheduling and Routing. The category \enquote{Others} includes e.g. Fantasy Football, Train Scheduling and different types for which only a small number of model files are available.}

		The \acf{strIPlib} is a collection of over 21000 mixed-integer programs with an exploitable structure such as Block-Diagonal and Staircase \todo{ref}.
		All instances are assign to exactly one of the 33 main categories as highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:eval:striplib}.
		Each categories is further sub-divided into a number of smaller sub-categories, because each kind of problem can be modeled (e.g. three-index vs. four-index) \textit{or} decomposed in a variety of different ways.
		
		The number of available instances per category ranges from as low as $2$ for Binary/Ternary Code Construction and up to $\approx 4700$ for Container Loading, which makes the data-set in-balanced with respect to available models per main category. This is only of theoretical concern and is further discussed in section \todo{ref}.
		Furthermore, the largest four categories account for $\approx 80\%$ of the total instance count with the remaining $20\%$ distributed across 29 categories.
		One singular category \enquote{Haplotype Inference} with 40 instances is excluded from all tests, because the problem files are not readable by either \acs{GCG} or \acs{SCIP}. This behavior can be traced back to the used variable names in these models, which all contain the special character \enquote{\^}.
