  abstract = {This thesis introduces the novel paradigm of "constraint integer programming" (CIP), which integrates constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) modeling and solving techniques. It is supplemented by the software SCIP, which is a solver and framework for constraint integer programming that also features SAT solving techniques. SCIP is freely available in source code for academic and non-commercial purposes. Our constraint integer programming approach is a generalization of MIP that allows for the inclusion of arbitrary constraints, as long as they turn into linear constraints on the continuous variables after all integer variables have been fixed. The constraints, may they be linear or more complex, are treated by any combination of CP and MIP techniques: the propagation of the domains by constraint specific algorithms, the generation of a linear relaxation and its solving by LP methods, and the strengthening of the LP by cutting plane separation. The current version of SCIP comes with all of the necessary components to solve mixed integer programs. In the thesis, we cover most of these ingredients and present extensive computational results to compare different variants for the individual building blocks of a MIP solver. We focus on the algorithms and their impact on the overall performance of the solver. In addition to mixed integer programming, the thesis deals with chip design verification, which is an important topic of electronic design automation. Chip manufacturers have to make sure that the logic design of a circuit conforms to the specification of the chip. Otherwise, the chip would show an erroneous behavior that may cause failures in the device where it is employed. An important subproblem of chip design verification is the property checking problem, which is to verify whether a circuit satisfies a specified property. We show how this problem can be modeled as constraint integer program and provide a number of problem-specific algorithms that exploit the structure of the individual constraints and the circuit as a whole. Another set of extensive computational benchmarks compares our CIP approach to the current state-of-the-art SAT methodology and documents the success of our method.},

  abstract = {Mixed integer programming has become a very powerful tool for modeling and solving real-world planning and scheduling problems, with the breadth of applications appearing to be almost unlimited. A critical component in the solution of these mixed integer programs is a set of routines commonly referred to as presolve. Presolve can be viewed as a collection of preprocessing techniques that reduce the size of and, more importantly, improve the “strength” of the given model formulation, that is, the degree to which the constraints of the formulation accurately describe the underlying polyhedron of integer-feasible solutions. As our computational results will show, presolve is a key factor in the speed with which we can solve mixed integer programs and is often the difference between a model being intractable and solvable, in some cases easily solvable. In this paper we describe the presolve functionality in the Gurobi commercial mixed integer programming code. This includes an overview, or taxonomy of the different methods that are employed, as well as more-detailed descriptions of several of the techniques, with some of them appearing, to our knowledge, for the first time in the literature.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We face the issue of finding alternative paradigms for the resolution of generic Mixed Integer Programs (MIP), by considering the perspective option of general purpose solvers which switch to decomposition methods when pertinent. Currently, the main blocking factor in their design is the problem of automatic decomposition of MIPs, that is to produce good MIP decompositions algorithmically, looking only at the algebraic structure of the MIP instance. We propose to employ Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation and machine learning methods to obtain a fully data driven automatic decomposition framework. We also design strategies and introduce algorithmic techniques in order to make such a framework computationally effective. An extensive experimental analysis shows our framework to grant substantial improvements, in terms of both solutions quality and computing time, with respect to state-of-the-art automatic decomposition techniques. It also allows us to gain insights into the relative impact of different techniques. As a side product of our research, we provide a dataset of more than 31 thousand random decompositions of MIPLIB instances, with 121 features, including computations of their root node relaxation.},

  abstract = {Despite vast improvements in computational power, many large-scale optimization problems involving integer variables remain difficult to solve. Certain classes, however, can be efficiently solved by exploiting special structure. One such structure is the singly bordered block-diagonal (BBD) structure that lends itself to Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation, and branch and price. We start by introducing a new measure of goodness to capture desired features in BBD structures such as granularity of the structure, homogeneity of the block sizes, and isomorphism of the blocks. We then use it to propose a new approach to identify the best BBD structure inherent in the constraint matrix. The main building block of the proposed approach is the use of a community detection methodology in lieu of graph/hypergraph partitioning methods to alleviate one major drawback of the existing approaches in the literature: predefining the number of blocks. When tested on MIPLIB2003/2010 instances and compared against the state-of-the-art technique, the proposed algorithm is found to identify very good structures and require shorter CPU time to reach comparable bounds, in most cases.},

  abstract = {Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area. The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas. The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful appl},
